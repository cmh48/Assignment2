# The History of the Internet
The internet was invented as a way to solve a problem like some many other inventions. Vent Cerf and Bob Kahn were 
working on a project ARPANET, a Defense project that was made to create a way for communication after a nuclear attack. 
That experiment was the result of what we now know as the internet.

What is the Internet?

The internet is a collection of multiple different pieces of computer and non-computer equipment talking to one another 
by means of a communications network either wired or wireless.

The internet sends binary information. Information is made of **bits** or any pair of opposites. Today bits are sent by
 electricity, light, radio.  
-Using electricity bits are sent faster by **band width,**  the maximum transmission capacity of a device. Band with 
is measured by **bitrate** (the number of bits per second a system can transmit. Another measure of speed is 
**latency,** the amount of time it takes for a bit to travel from sender to receiver. 
-Using light is for sending bits very long distances. Using a fiber-optic cable, we can send bits as light beams 
- We send information wireless through the use of radio signal 

The internet is made up of independently operated networks, or networks of networks. Linking devices together around
 the world. WIFI connections devices to a ISP (internet service provider), and the ISP connects you to hundreds of 
 other networks.
 
 **All devices on the internet have unique addresses**

 The IP address is the most important also know as the _Internet Protocol_
 When a person vis0ts a web page the computer is initially asking another computer for information. The IP address is
   used by the computer to know where to send the response.
   
   The IP Address has a hierarchy. The numbers are made up of an average of 32 bits.  The first set of number identify
   Country/Network -- Region/Network, then sub networks, and lastly the device. 
   
   **Domain Name System (DNS)**
   Originally created to be an open and public communications protocol for governments and educations organizations.
   
   Associates names with IP Addresses. Computers use DNS to look up domain names and retrieves the associated IP Address
   to your computer to your destination on the internet. 
   
   DNS servers are connected in a hierarchy divided by zones where they have different roles. Such as .com, .org, .net,
    etc.
